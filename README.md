# KP_Unsupervised_ML_Challenge

## Challenge
You are on the data science team of a medical research company that’s interested in finding better ways to predict myopia, or nearsightedness. Your team has tried—and failed—to improve their classification model when training on the whole dataset. However, they believe that there might be distinct groups of patients that would be better to analyze separately. So, your supervisor has asked you to explore this possibility by using unsupervised learning.

You have been provided with raw data, so you’ll first need to process it to fit the machine learning models. You will use several clustering algorithms to explore whether the patients can be placed into distinct groups. Then, you’ll create a visualization to share your findings with your team and other key stakeholders.

**My Recommendation**

My recommendation based on the analysis is that the patients can be separated into three distinct groups. Performing dimension reductionality we were able to capture 91% of the different attributes of the patients. Furthermore, we were able to look at KMeans inertia to identify an elbow curve. While not quite fully distinct, it is possible to see that the data's last prominent bend is at the three cluster mark.
